1. How to bind USB serial adapter to a fixed node?
---------------------------------------------------
FTDI serial adapter have unique serial numbers, we can create rules according to this attribute.
Type this line into terminal to see the serial number of a FTDI adapter which has a device node of /dev/ttyUSB0:

udevadm info -a -n /dev/ttyUSB0 | grep '{serial}'

The output should be something like this:

ATTRS{serial}=="AIO28765"
ATTRS{serial}=="bcm2708_usb"

Then we can create a rule by creating a file:
/etc/udev/rules.d/10-usbserial.rules
Since "10" is smaller than "40" and "99", which belong to system, this rule we created has higher priority than system defaults.
The content of the rule file:

SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{serial}=="AIO28765", GROUP="plugdev", SYMLINK+="ttyUSB_Radio"

This rule file will create a symlink named ttyUSB_Radio when the serial adapter plugged in. Notice that idVendor and idProduct apply for FTDI chips only, they should be modified according to different vendors of chips.
